title: Expect More and Worry Less
---

Tomorrow will be the first day of the bootcamp. I would like to prepare my mindset well. Below is the list:

* Expect more and worry less
* Use Python instead of Excel
* Be confident
* Avoid Imposter Syndrome and Perfectionism
* Don't be embarrassed to ask for help
* Work together, make connections, and learn from others
* Think about how to benefit the community and the world
* Keep learning, keep going and keep moving
* Have fun and stay positive
* Learn by doing
* Practice, practice, and practice
* Believe you haven't learn it through, not you can't do it
* Build a lot of simple things, not one hard thing
* Be patience, take it step by step, and pace myself
* Compare yourself to only yourself
* Focus on the moment and enjoy
