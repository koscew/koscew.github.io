# The Road to Programming at Mid-30s

I'm using this website/blog to write how I learn programming at my mid-30s.

My programming experience:
* High School:
    * Some assignments of Visual Studio
* University/Graduate school: 
    * SAS to run some testing like regression, z-test, t-test 
* Self-Learning
    * SQL, 2014
    * Python, 2021
